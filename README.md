# Northcoders News API

`nc-news` is a RESTful API which mimics the back-end of a sharing platform such as
Reddit. Users can post articles and interact with posted articles by adding
comments and upvoting/downvoting. It has been built with Node.js and Postgres
and deployed with Render: https://be-nc-news-lo1x.onrender.com

```

npm run seed
```
